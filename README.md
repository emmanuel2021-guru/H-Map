# H-Map

H-Map is a web application that allows users to explore the history of any location on a map. Users can search for a place, zoom in and out, and click on any point to see historical facts, images, and videos related to that location. H-Map uses the Google Maps API, the Wikipedia API, and the YouTube API to fetch and display the relevant data.
